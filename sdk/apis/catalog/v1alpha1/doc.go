// Package v1alpha1 contains the catalog API for the kbind service layer:
// the Export and Collection kinds in the catalog.kbind.io group. The catalog
// is curation on top of the core's raw discovery — human-facing metadata and
// defaults that turn "a list of CRD names" into "a service you'd choose".
// These CRDs live on the provider and are read only by the gateway/UI/CLI;
// the konnector never sees them. See docs/proposals/v2-extended.md.
