# Create the two kind clusters for the Tilt dev loop (idempotent):
#   kbind-provider — runs the backend (gateway + issuer)
#   kbind-consumer — runs the konnector
# Both live on the shared "kind" docker network, so consumer pods reach the
# provider API server at https://kbind-provider-control-plane:6443.
