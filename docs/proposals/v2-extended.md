# kbind v2 Extended: Backend API, CLI, UI

* Status: **ACCEPTED, in implementation**
* Authors: @mjudeikis
* Date: 2026-06-10 (updated 2026-07-29 for the kbind rename + root-layout restructure)
* Builds on: [v2-slim-core.md](v2-slim-core.md) (implemented on the `v2-next` branch)

## Summary

The v2 core contract is up for discussion: a binding is one `kubectl apply` of a Secret +
`Connection` + bindings, consumed by the konnector, with zero kube-bind components on
the provider. This proposal designs everything *around* that contract, the optional
service layer that answers the questions the core deliberately doesn't:

* **Who are you?** (auth: OIDC, sessions)
* **What may you have?** (catalog: curated offerings on top of raw exported APIs)
* **Here are your credentials.** (issuer: per-consumer SA/RBAC/kubeconfig, tenancy)
* **Here is your bundle.** (gateway: HTTP API whose terminal output is the one-apply file)
* **You stopped coming.** (reaper: GC keyed off the core's Lease)
* **Make it pleasant.** (CLI, UI)

The defining rule, inherited from the core: **every path through this layer terminates
in the same one-apply bundle.** The service layer negotiates, it never syncs. If the
backend is deleted the day after binding, sync is unaffected.

            └────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

## Goals

* Every component independently deployable and optional, any subset works. The core
  (GitOps-only, no extended layer at all) remains a first-class path forever.
* The backend's terminal output is **exactly** the core's one-apply bundle, no
  intermediate request/response CRDs on the consumer, no phase-gated handshake.
* Tenancy lives here: per-consumer provider namespaces / kcp workspaces are an issuer
  concern, invisible to the core (which just sees a kubeconfig whose RBAC fences it in).
* Pluggable auth from day one, OIDC is the reference implementation, not the contract.
* HA-capable by construction (the v1 in-memory-session/single-replica limitation,
  roadmap #424/#488, must not survive into v2).

## Non-Goals

* Anything that changes core sync semantics, the core contract is immutable, this layer must adapt around it.
* Marketplace/billing/quotas (a future layer above this one, the catalog leaves room).
* Re-implementing v1's wire protocol (`BindingProvider`, `BindingResourceResponse`,
  `APIServiceExportRequest` flow). v2 extended is a clean protocol.

## Components

### 1. Catalog (provider-side CRDs)

Raw discovery already exists in core (`Connection.status.exportedAPIs` from labeled
CRDs / the workspace boundary). The catalog adds **curation**: human-facing metadata
and sensible defaults that turn "a list of CRD names" into "a service you'd choose".

Group: `catalog.kbind.io`. Two kinds, successors of v1's
`APIServiceExportTemplate` and `Collection`:

```yaml
apiVersion: catalog.kbind.io/v1alpha1
kind: Export                          # one offering
metadata:
  name: mangodb
spec:
  title: MangoDB
  description: Managed MangoDB instances with automated backups.
  icon: { url: … }                    # optional
  docs: https://…                     # optional
  apis:                               # what a binding to this offering syncs
    - name: mangodbs.mangodb.io
    - name: mangodbbackups.mangodb.io
  defaults:                           # copied into the generated ClusterBinding
    conflictPolicy: Fail
    relatedResources:
      - group: ""
        resource: secrets
        direction: FromProvider
        selector:
          labelSelector:
            matchLabels:
              mangodb.io/managed: "true"
```

```yaml
apiVersion: catalog.kbind.io/v1alpha1
kind: Collection                      # grouping for UI/CLI browsing
metadata:
  name: databases
spec:
  title: Databases
  exports:
    - name: mangodb
```

Notes:

* The catalog is **derived-from-core-truth**: an `Export` listing an API that isn't
  actually exported (label/boundary) gets a condition, the gateway hides it. The label
  remains the source of truth, the catalog is presentation + defaults.
* These CRDs live on the provider and are read only by the gateway/UI/CLI. The
  konnector never sees them.

### 2. Issuer (provider-side controller)

Everything v1's `backend/kubernetes` did, made a named component. The issuer is a Go
interface (provision boundary, mint credentials, revoke), **the in-tree implementation
is plain Kubernetes only**, the kcp issuer lives in the separate `contrib/kcp`
distribution, which wires its own implementation against the same interface.

* Per consumer identity: provision the tenancy boundary, a namespace set on plain
  Kubernetes (workspaces, in the contrib/kcp issuer).
* Mint credentials: ServiceAccount + RBAC scoped to exactly the exported APIs (+
  declared related resources) within that boundary + kubeconfig. This fixes v1's
  cluster-admin-ish `kube-binder` ClusterRole (roadmap #303: reduced footprint). On a
  plain-Kubernetes provider "scoped to the exported APIs" is an explicit Role enumerating
  those resources, on the kcp/CRD-less flavor the tenancy boundary *is* the workspace, so
  scoping is the workspace grant itself (everything in it is exported by construction)
  rather than a per-resource enumeration, same `Issuer` interface, two scoping mechanisms
  matching the core's two schema sources.
* **Credential mechanism: long-lived SA token** (v1 behavior, secret-based
  ServiceAccount token). Trade-off accepted deliberately: zero rotation friction and no
  konnector-side refresh machinery, at the cost of security posture, and noting
  upstream Kubernetes is steering away from secret-based SA tokens, so this is
  revisitable without API change (the bundle's Secret is replaceable, a bounded-token +
  reissue mode can be added later behind the same interface). Revocation = delete the
  `Grant` → issuer deletes the SA/token.
* Records issuance in **`Grant`** (`iam.kbind.io`, an issuance/identity record, not
  catalog presentation): "identity X was issued credentials Y for export Z". The anchor
  for revocation, audit, and the reaper.

### 3. Gateway (HTTP API)

Stateless HTTP server (sessions externalized), serving:

One gateway fronts exactly **one provider**, catalog aggregation across providers is a
future layer above this one, already possible externally because the protocol's output
is just a bundle.

| Endpoint | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `GET /api/provider` | provider metadata + supported auth methods (successor of v1 `/api/exports`) |
| `GET /api/catalog` | `Export`s + `Collection`s visible to the caller |
| `POST /api/bind` | input: export name + consumer identity → drives issuer → returns a **one-time pickup URL** for the bundle |
| `GET /api/bundle/<token>` | single-use, short-TTL (5 min) bundle pickup, **returns the bundle**, then the token is dead |
| `POST /api/apply` | optional, flag-gated: browser-apply path, gateway applies the bundle (+ konnector install) into a consumer cluster using a caller-supplied consumer kubeconfig |
| `GET /api/authorize`, `/api/callback` | auth flow (delegated to authenticator plugin) |
| `GET /api/healthz` | health |

**The bundle is the one-apply file**, delivered through a one-time pickup URL so live
credentials are fetched exactly once and never stored at rest in the gateway. Content
negotiation on pickup: `application/yaml` returns the literal multi-doc bundle (Secret +
`Connection` + `ClusterBinding`), `application/json` wraps the same objects in a thin
envelope (`{ bundle: [...] }`). There is no other handshake state: no request objects to
poll, no phases to wait on. `curl` bind + pickup piped to `kubectl apply -f -` is a
complete client.

The single-use, short-TTL property applies to the **pickup URL**, not to the credential
inside it: the bundle's Secret carries the long-lived SA token minted by the issuer
(§2), so a bundle that has been picked up once stays valid and re-appliable. That is what
makes `-o yaml > binding.yaml` committed to git a real GitOps artifact, the pickup is
consumed once, the token it delivered keeps working until its `Grant` is revoked.
Re-running `bind` mints a fresh `Grant`/token and a new pickup, it does not invalidate a
previously committed bundle unless that `Grant` is explicitly revoked.

### 4. Auth (pluggable)

* `Authenticator` interface: `Routes()` (mounted under `/api/auth/…`) +
  `Authenticate(r) (Identity, error)`. Reference implementations: OIDC (code grant +
  PKCE, as v1) and `kubernetes` (TokenReview against the provider, for in-platform
  UIs that already hold a cluster identity).
* The embedded mock-OIDC server survives **only** as a dev-mode flag (`--oidc-mock`).
* OIDC is configured with kube-apiserver/kcp-style flags: `--oidc-issuer-url`,
  `--oidc-client-id`, `--oidc-client-secret`, `--oidc-ca-file`,
  `--oidc-username-claim`, `--oidc-groups-claim`, `--oidc-scopes`,
  `--oidc-redirect-url`.
* Sessions are **stateless encrypted cookies/tokens** (keys via
  `--cookie-signing-key`/`--cookie-encryption-key`), no session store at all. With
  shared keys, any number of gateway replicas works out of the box, the same encrypted
  blob doubles as the CLI's bearer token. (Supersedes the earlier memory/Redis
  session-store idea: the only server-side state the flow ever needed, one-time bundle
  pickup, lives on the `Grant` via annotations with optimistic concurrency, so the
  gateway keeps zero state.)
* Identity → tenancy key: `issuer + "/" + subject` hash, as v1, so the same human gets
  the same boundary on re-bind.

### 5. Reaper (provider-side, optional)

The core leaves dead-consumer GC explicitly to this layer, keyed off the per-Connection
`Lease` the konnector maintains. That core primitive is implemented (the konnector
renews a `coordination.k8s.io/Lease` per Connection on the provider), so the reaper is
unblocked.

* Lease expired beyond TTL → mark the issuance stale → (configurably) revoke
  credentials, then delete kube-bind-created namespaces and synced objects.
* TTLs and the destructive step are opt-in and conservative by default (revoke ≠
  delete, deletion requires explicit enablement).

### 6. CLI (`kbind`)

Thin client over the gateway, everything it does is reproducible by hand. Named `kbind`
(a copy/symlink as `kubectl-bind` makes it a kubectl plugin). The **krew plugin name
stays `bind`** (kept from v1, `kubectl krew install bind` keeps working): release
archives ship the binary as `kubectl-bind`, and krew-release-bot renders `.krew.yaml`
against each GitHub release to PR krew-index (`.github/workflows/cli.yaml`).

```sh
kubectl bind login https://mangodb.example.com               # auth, cache token
kubectl bind catalog                                         # list Exports/Collections
kubectl bind export mangodb                             # bind an Export:
                                                      #   POST /api/bind → bundle
                                                      #   → apply (or -o yaml)
kubectl bind export mangodb -o yaml > binding.yaml      # GitOps mode: print, don't apply
```

* `--install-konnector` (default on for interactive use) installs/upgrades the v2
  konnector, as v1 did.
* The CLI never creates bespoke objects, it applies the gateway's bundle verbatim.
  `-o yaml` output committed to git is byte-for-byte the GitOps path.
* v1 subcommands that existed to ferry the old handshake (`apiservice`, `deploy`,
  per-resource polling) disappear.

### 7. UI (SPA)

Browse catalog → authenticate → bind → then either:

* **download the bundle** (via the one-time pickup URL) / copy a `kubectl bind`
  one-liner, or
* **browser-apply** (v1's UI-only flow, roadmap #406, kept): the user supplies a
  consumer-cluster kubeconfig (or the UI runs in-platform where one is already held),
  and the gateway's `/api/apply` applies the bundle and installs the konnector into the
  consumer cluster.

The UI is a pure gateway client, it holds no flow state the gateway doesn't have.
Browser-apply is flag-gated on the gateway and off by default, it means consumer
credentials transit the gateway, which deployments must consciously accept.

## Packaging & repo

Post-restructure layout (the repo root is the kbind module, `sdk/` is the standalone
type module):

```
kbind/
├── sdk/apis/core/v1alpha1/       # core (implemented)
├── sdk/apis/catalog/v1alpha1/    # Export, Collection
├── sdk/apis/iam/v1alpha1/        # Grant
├── backend/                      # this proposal's server-side packages
│   ├── auth/                     #   Authenticator iface, OIDC (+dev mock), sessions
│   ├── issuer/                   #   Issuer iface + kube impl + Grant controller
│   ├── gateway/                  #   HTTP API + embedded UI
│   └── reaper/                   #   Lease-keyed GC
├── cli/                          # kbind CLI packages
├── web/                          # SPA sources (embedded into the gateway)
├── cmd/konnector/                # core (implemented)
├── cmd/backend/                  # kbind-backend binary
└── cmd/kbind/                    # CLI binary
```

The backend ships as **one binary with module flags** (`--enable-gateway`,
`--enable-issuer`, `--enable-reaper`, `--enable-apply`), operational simplicity over
purity, the boundaries stay as Go packages so a future split costs a `main.go`, not a
refactor. Types the backend serves live in `sdk` (separate module) so integrations can
depend on the APIs without the server. A future kcp distribution provides its own issuer
implementation behind the same interface (it no longer lives in this repo).

## Migration notes

* The v1 wire protocol is not bridged: v1 CLI cannot talk to a v2 gateway. Both stacks
  can run side by side on one provider during transition (different endpoints, disjoint
  CRD groups).
* v1 catalog objects (`APIServiceExportTemplate`/`Collection`) translate mechanically
  to `Export`/`Collection`, a converter script ships with the backend.

## Decided

* **Packaging**: one `kube-bind-backend` binary, gateway/issuer/reaper/apply are module
  flags, boundaries kept as Go packages.
* **Issuance anchor**: `Grant` in `iam.kbind.io`, the typed record of
  "identity X was issued credentials Y for export Z", anchor for revocation, audit,
  reaper. Kept out of `catalog.kbind.io` so that group stays purely presentation+defaults.
* **Credentials**: long-lived secret-based SA token (v1 behavior), zero rotation
  friction accepted over security posture, revocation via `Grant` deletion, bounded
  tokens addable later behind the same issuer interface without API change.
* **Catalog vocabulary**: `Export` + `Collection`.
* **Bundle delivery**: one-time pickup URL, 5-minute TTL, single use, the TTL/single-use
  applies to the *pickup URL*, not the long-lived SA token inside, so a picked-up bundle
  stays re-appliable (GitOps-safe). The bundle is never stored at rest in the gateway.
* **kcp**: stays a separate distribution (`contrib/kcp`) providing its own issuer
  implementation, the in-tree backend issuer is plain Kubernetes only.
* **UI reach**: browser-apply path **kept** (roadmap #406), gateway `/api/apply`
  applies bundle + installs konnector into the consumer cluster with a caller-supplied
  kubeconfig, flag-gated, off by default, consumer credentials transiting the gateway
  is an explicitly accepted trade-off when enabled.
* **Federation**: one gateway = one provider, cross-provider aggregation is a future
  layer above the bundle protocol.

Added 2026-07-29 (implementation round):

* **Naming**: project is **kbind**. Groups `catalog.kbind.io` (Export, Collection) and
  `iam.kbind.io` (Grant), binaries `kbind-backend` and `kbind` (CLI, kubectl-plugin
  compatible), packages `backend/`, `cli/`, `web/` in the root module.
* **Sessions**: stateless encrypted cookie/bearer tokens, no session store (see §4).
  HA needs only shared cookie keys across replicas.
* **One-time pickup without gateway state**: the pickup token is
  `<grant-name>.<random>`, the gateway stamps `sha256(random)` + expiry as annotations
  on the `Grant` at bind time and removes them (optimistic concurrency) on pickup. The
  bundle itself is (re)constructed on demand from the issuer's token Secret, never
  stored at rest, single-use enforced by the API server, HA-safe.
* **Grant is spec-resolved at bind time**: the gateway copies the `Export`'s API list +
  defaults into `Grant.spec`, so issuance is a stable record even if the catalog entry
  changes later. The issuer controller provisions namespace/SA/RBAC from `Grant.spec`
  and reports the artifacts in `Grant.status`, deletion (revocation) unwinds via an
  `iam.kbind.io/cleanup` finalizer.
* **Lease ↔ Grant link (per-grant)**: the issued kubeconfig pins its context namespace
  to the per-consumer boundary namespace, and the konnector's heartbeat writes its
  Lease into the kubeconfig's context namespace when set (falling back to the `kbind`
  namespace). The Lease is named `<connection>-<consumer-uid-prefix>` and annotated
  with its Connection name, since the bundle names the Connection after the Grant, the
  reaper judges staleness **per grant** by that annotation. Fallback for hand-renamed
  Connections is conservative: any fresh Lease in the boundary keeps its Grants alive,
  only a fully silent boundary goes stale. RBAC for Leases stays scoped to the
  tenant's own namespace.
* **kubernetes authenticator**: implemented as **TokenReview** (not SAR, SAR is
  authorization, identity comes from TokenReview) against the provider, behind
  `--kubernetes-auth`. Tenancy key `kubernetes#<username>`. No interactive routes,
  in-platform callers just send their own bearer token.
* **Packaging (charts)**: `deploy/charts/backend` ships the service layer (module
  flags as values, catalog+iam CRDs, Service, RBAC incl. `escalate`/`bind` so the
  issuer may create Roles enumerating APIs the backend itself does not hold, OIDC
  client secret and cookie keys via existing Secrets).
* **UI**: dependency-free static SPA (embedded via `go:embed` into the gateway), no
  build toolchain in the repo, pure gateway client.

## Open questions

None, initial design questions resolved (see **Decided**). New questions raised during
review go here.
